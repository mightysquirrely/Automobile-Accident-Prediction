The risks overall vary by <1%, and therefore it doesn't seem a strong statement to make for clients to base decisions from.  \nCertain months of the years showed a variance in accidents that could vary by more than 200 compared to other months in the same year.  This merits further investigation by a client or company who wishes to use this information.  The weather may have played a factor or perhaps the economy.  \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
