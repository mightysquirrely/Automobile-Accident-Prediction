# Capstone-1-Project

This project uses Maryland's Montgomery County Traffic Stop Database in order to
show the applications of Data Science in forecasting and future
prediction. The impact of this project is significant and it can contribute in
understanding risk factor for traffic violations and accidents using
statistical analysis, machine learning and data science. Experiments are designed and executed in order to generate
actionable insights. It included the use of standard machine learning
algorithms.  Experiments have shown good prediction results using Logistic
Regression and Decision Trees algorithms which can predict whether
certain data points and information can lead to traffic accidents with an
accuracy of 77%.
