# Capstone-1-Project
This project uses Maryland's Montgomery County Traffic Stop Database in order to
show the applications of Data Science in forecasting and future
prediction. The impact of this project is significant and it can contribute in
understanding the risk factors for traffic violations and accidents using
statistical analysis, machine learning and data science. Experiments are designed and executed in order to generate
actionable insights. It included the use of standard machine learning
algorithms.  Experiments have shown good prediction results using Logistic
Regression and Decision Tree algorithms which can predict whether
certain data points and information can lead to traffic accidents with an
accuracy of 77%.

**Problem Statement:**
Automobile accidents are a part of society today. It is reasonable to believe if there is a way to predict
what causes their increased likelihood, the overall society would benefit. The goal of this project is to
look at connections in accident frequency for automobiles based on particular factors such the color of
the automobile or the time of the year.

**Proposed Solution:**
Perform exploratory analysis and predictive modeling from a large dataset of a Montgomery county,
Maryland. Insurance agencies, automobile dealerships and manufacturers can benefit in knowing what
factors correlate with accidents occurring in automobiles.
• Accurate predictive models can give dealerships a way to detect what colors will sell better
based on accident data.
• Accurate predictive models can give insurance companies data to work with if determining cost
of particular color vehicles and time of year being driven.
• There is the potential for this to lead to safer automobiles on the roads if there is a high
correlation of accidents with particular colors. Automobile manufacturers and dealerships may
sway the colors to be safer, or sway their marketing campaigns for having vehicles with lower
accident rates.

**Conclusion:**
Certain colors of vehicles have a slightly higher risk for being in an accident when looking at the
percentages related to each individual color. The risks overall vary by <1%, and therefore it doesn't
seem a strong statement to make for clients to base decisions from.
Certain months of the years showed a variance in accidents that could vary by more than 200 compared
to other months in the same year. This merits further investigation by a client or company who wishes
to use this information. The weather may have played a factor or perhaps the economy.
